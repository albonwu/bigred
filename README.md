## Inspiration

Reading out of an digital physics book in online school illuminated the shortcomings of screen-readers when it comes to textbook formulas. In most cases, the readers would skip over the equations or say something incomprehensible - which would particularly affect people who rely on text-to-speech technologies, perhaps due to visual impairment.

## What it does

Respoke improves accessibility in academia by providing clear, fluent natural language readings of equations and formulas.

## Installation/Setup

### Frontend Chrome Extension

Based on [`extension-cli`](https://oss.mobilefirst.me/extension-cli/).

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in your browser load the unpacked extension from `frontend/dist`.

### Frontend Standalone Page

```sh
cd backend
streamlit run stream.py
```
If this doesn't work, try running the first block of code in the Backend section to set up your virtual environment.

### Backend

```sh
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file with the following keys:

```sh
CARTESIA_API_KEY=(the uuid key from cartesia)
PINATA_API_JWT=(the jwt key from pinata.cloud)
PINATA_GATEWAY=get-this-url-from-pinata.mypinata.cloud
```

Change the `model_id` variable in `app.py` to be that of the endpoint of your deployed Vertex AI model. To do this, go to Vertex AI > Deploy and Use > Online prediction, and copy the id of the endpoint you wish to use. Then, replace `model_id` in `app.py` with

```py
model_id = f"projects/{project id}/locations/{location}/endpoints/{endpoint id}"
```

## How we built it

We fine-tuned Gemini 1.5 Flash on GCP's Vertex AI Platform. To acquire data for this purpose, we thought about conventions and stylistic patterns that balanced between concision and clarity when describing complex mathematical equations written in LaTeX. Below are some patterns and rules we took into consideration:

- `\sqrt{n}` -> “square root of (the quantity) n”
- `\frac{a}{b}` -> “fraction with numerator (the quantity) a and denominator (the quantity) b”
- `\sum_{i = 0}^\infty f(i)` -> “sum from i equals 0 to infinity of (the quantity) f(i)”
- `\binom{a}{b}` -> “binomial coefficient with upper index (the quantity) a and lower index (the quantity) b”

_Append “followed by” if character immediately after } is not }_

_Append “followed by \[structure\]” if multiple “followed by”s are consecutive_

We then wrote a Python script to construct expressions of varying complexity, simulating ones likely to appear across different fields of math. With the dataset constructed, we fine-tuned Gemini 1.5 with it, after which we deployed the new model using a Vertex endpoint.

Building the front-end involved creating a browser extension to extract MathML and LaTeX from existing equations, sending it to the backend, and inserting audio elements for equations.

## Challenges we ran into

Integrating with Cartesia's TTS API meant we had to learn a lot about server side events and audio encoding to bring our descriptions to life.

When fine-tuning Gemini, we thought hard about how to strike a balance between brevity and clarity. We didn't want the model to be so concise it became vague, nor so detailed that its translation was cumbersome. As shown above, we had to construct a list of general patterns and principles that motivated the construction of the fine-tuning dataset.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Quickly learning how to build a web extension that extracts equation information from webpages was a first for us.

## What we learned

How easy Pinata is to use and the importance of having a low-friction file system in developing quickly.

## What's next for Respoke

Integration with computer vision to detect equations of any format, and decreasing latency.
